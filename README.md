Note: GATHEROOM is a complete open source project. It is recommended a contributor using his/her own resources such as private email, computer, and time etc. instead of a company's resource, if the contributor is actively serving in a company, unless approved by his/her company.

GATHEROOM is a sub-project of Project-X. The mission is to create an online conference application to support distributed teamwork.
